Lectures in Software Engineering

Various presentations, talks and lectures I have given in software engineering
over the years. 

Note that the LaTeX beamer slides should be compiled with xelatex instead of
pdflatex. 

I've made use of the [Stockholm Beamer
Theme](https://github.com/hendryolson/sthlmBeamerTheme) with some slight
modifications. 
* Removed the bacgkround image from the title slide.
* Changed the font from Helvetica Neue UltraLight to Light.

The first presentation is a lecture on Software Architecture and
Architectural Design which I gave in 2003 to a 3rd year undegraduate Software
Engineering class.

The second presentation is the follow up lecture to the Architectural Design
lecture. This one focuses on using UML for detailed software design.
