Lectures in Software Engineering

Various presentations, talks and lectures I have given in software engineering
over the years. 

Note that the LaTeX beamer slides should be compiled with xelatex instead of
pdflatex. 

I've made use of the [Stockholm Beamer
Theme](https://github.com/hendryolson/sthlmBeamerTheme) with some slight
modifications. 
* Removed the bacgkround image from the title slide.
* Changed the font from Helvetica Neue UltraLight to Light.

The first presentation is a lecture on Software Architecture and
Architectural Design which I gave in 2003 to a 3rd year undegraduate Software
Engineering class.

The second presentation is the follow up lecture to the Architectural Design
lecture. This one focuses on using UML for detailed software design.

The next set of slides was presented to a group of computational scientists,
operations researchers and analysts undertaking modelling and simulation.
The slides are gentle introduction to some relevant Software Engineering
concepts. The presentation is from July 2001.
